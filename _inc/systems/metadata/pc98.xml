      <systemDescription>The NEC PC-9800 was line of personal computers developed in 1982 in Japan by NEC Corporation based on IBM, aimed exclusively at the Japanese market.

The first model was a 16-bit architecture with an Intel 8086 processor clocked at 5 MHz and 128 KB of RAM. It shipped with graphics cards capable of displaying 8 colors at 640x400 resolution - a clear performance differentiator compared to PCs of the time.

Initially conceived as a solution for industrial and office applications, by 1987 the PC-9801 series captured nearly 90% of the Japanese personal computer market. Over time, as power increased and graphics and sound effects were appreciated by home users (especially gamers), it also became popular for non-commercial applications - the Touhou Project series, for example, made its debut.</systemDescription>

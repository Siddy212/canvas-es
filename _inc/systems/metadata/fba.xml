      <systemDescription>This source-available project is based on FinalBurn, created by Dave in 2000. It has been programmed by a team composed of Barry Harris (Old username: TrebleWinner), Jan_Klaassen, KEV, LoopMaster, Mike Haggar, Hyper Yagami and Ayeye.

FinalBurn was one of the first Capcom CPS2 emulators. When this project came to a halt in 2001, its sources were widely disseminated, allowing the development of many unofficial versions, of which FBA is the most successful.

Differentiated from other emulators by a very large number of supported systems, FB Alpha also offers a clear interface (simple like that of Kawaks) and excellent performance. The icing on the cake; it's not resource-intensive, and you don't need to indulge in complex settings to take it in hand immediately, although its menus are natively in English.</systemDescription>

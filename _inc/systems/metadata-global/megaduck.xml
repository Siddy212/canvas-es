      <systemDescription>The Welback Holdings Mega Duck, usually just referred to as Mega Duck, is a fourth generation (1987-2004) handheld video game console developed and distributed by Welback Holdings, but marketed under different names like Creatronic, Videojet, Cougar USA, and Hartung. It was released in August 1993 in Netherlands at a retail price of fl 129 as the Creatronic Mega Duck. The console was also released in Germany (1993) distributed by Hartung, France (1993) distributed by Videojet, and Brazil (1993) but as the Cougar USA Cougar Boy. The Mega Duck was an obvious clone of the Game Boy in looks, and it sadly lacked any innovative games to set it apart to become a competitor. The console was discontinued quietly sometime in early 1995.</systemDescription>

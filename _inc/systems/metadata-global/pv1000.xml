      <systemDescription>The Casio PV-1000 (ぴーぶいせん, Pi Bui-Sen) is a third-generation home video game console manufactured by Casio and released in Japan in 1983. It was discontinued less than a year after release.

The PV-1000 was released in October 1983. It was only released in Japan where it sold for 14,800 yen. Casio failed to achieve a significant market share. According to retrogames.co.uk the console was pulled after several weeks; due to low sales.

The PV-1000 is powered by a Zilog Z80 CPU, with 2 KB RAM, with 1 KB allocated as VRAM. It also has an additional 1 KB devoted to a character generator. Graphics were provided by a Texas Instruments TMS9918, generating a 256x192 pixel resolution with 8 colours. The console contains a NEC D65010G031 chip used to output video and sound. It had three square wave voices with 6 bits to control the period.</systemDescription>
